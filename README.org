* Prometheus for emacs

This will eventually (possibly?) contain a set of modes for working with Prometheus in emacs.

For now, it only has =prometheus-data-mode= which is a read-only mode for looking at data/metrics from prometheus exporters.

It does look a little like angry fruit-salad with the current font-locking and I am very open to improvements.

** Why?

Because looking at data without any kind of highlighting is just painful.

** Is it good?

No, it's great!

** Features

1. syntax highlighting (or font-locking in emacs speak)
2. imenu support
3. magic file detection

It might be a good idea to add =eldoc= support.

** Installation

*MELPA*
Yeah, I should probably do that too.
