* Prometheus for emacs

This will eventually (possibly?) contain a set of modes for working with Prometheus in emacs.

For now, it only has =prometheus-data-mode= which is a read-only mode for looking at data/metrics from prometheus exporters.

It does look a little like angry fruit-salad with the current font-locking and I am very open to improvements.

** Why?

Because looking at data without any kind of highlighting is just painful.

** Is it good?

No, it's great!

** Features

1. syntax highlighting (or font-locking in emacs speak)
2. imenu support
3. magic file detection

It might be a good idea to add =eldoc= support.

** Installation

*Doom*
#+CAPTION: packages.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! prometheus-mode
  :recipe (:host gitlab :repo "peterhoeg/prometheus-mode"))
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: config.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package prometheus-mode
  :defer t)
#+end_src

*MELPA*\\
Yeah, I should probably do that too.

** Contributing

I'm very open to PRs. For any regexp changes, please use =(rx)=, which while being far more verbose than just straight up regexps in strings, is much nicer to read.
